# dnb-bts
This repository will provide source codes used in a work on analysis of gene expression profiles in mice administered BTS. The source codes will be uploaded after the paper is accepted and published.

## Requirements

The source codes are written in Python 3. In addition, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, and NetworkX packages are required. All of them are included in Anaconda. Graphviz and graphviz, a python wrapper Graphviz, are also required.

A gene expression data set GSE112653 is analyzed. Because the data size is large, the data set will not be included in this repository. Therefore, in order to run the source codes locally, please download the data set from [Gene Expression omnibus (GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database and put them into the *data* directory.
